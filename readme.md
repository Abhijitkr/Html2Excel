# Html to Excel Convertor

__Html to Excel Convertor__ is developed to help the web surfers. Sometimes you see some informative tables in the web and you just want to save it somewhere so that you can refer to it later but here is the twist, you will not see the download or save button anywhere. So here I am with a tool to solve your problem.

You just need to get the table html tag and you will be able to download in Excel Format. My recommendation is to download your __Excel in CSV Format__. You may be facing some issue in executing the Xls file in mobile device so go for CSV and enjoy :)
